This is my proposal for the custom api I'm working on.

I decided to make a personal music history api. I want to implement an ETL process to add CSV data to a database (postgres). Then use Express to show some of my personal data such as

Such as:
- Average time spent listening to new songs.
- Most played artist across all the data.
- Longest and shortest song.
- Longest and shortest title.

Python for the ETL process. (I find it the easiest and best for parsing data and transforming it.)
Node.js and Express for routing and server build.
PostgreSQL for the database architecture
Prisma for the schema

I plan to spend a few days collecting data and turning it into CSV
Then spend a half a day working on the schema to understand what I want the data to look like.
Rest of that day make sure the data fits the schema
the rest of the time working on the different controllers and functions associated with the routes
